1//  ------------   PROJECT OVERVIEW-----------
{
1.1  ------- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY-----
    {
single player sci-fi 2D top-down management simulation  game where the player fills the role of a single spaceship 
captain where his role is to manage his crew and keep them happy by building and maintaining the
infrastructure in the spaceship, keep them safe in combat and spplying ship policy and discipline.
	}

1.2 ------------ HIGH CONCEPT --------
	{

	the game is centered in the crew and the simulation of their needs and how those affect their preformance
of the spaceship partially designed by the captain, while giving the captain combat objectives and random 
encounters while he flies in space. those missions will enhance the experience of the crew simulation and will not
drive the attention of the gameplay ealseware.
	}	
1.5 ----------- TARGET AUDIENCE----
	{
management sims fans
    }
}


2//-----------------GAME OVERVIEW--------------------------
{
2.1 ------------ GENERAL OVERVIEW ---------
	{
	the whole games goes arround the crew, building facilities and enforcing policies to make them efficient
	and happy/affraid. the Maslow's hierarchy of needs will model basic crew needs. randomly given perks will
	determine where and what things crewmen do in their free time with the given infrastructure the player provides
	
	the player will not directly control the crew, he will appoint officers, assign duty roasters, ect
	
	}

2.2 ------------- STORY ----------
		{
	in a random region of space, an old relic lies, an old ship lost for millenia.
	 after an unknown accident killed your crew complement, you wake up only to find dead bodies within your hull
	 as you, an AI commanding a now long abbandoned space vessel, encounter this scene and yourself in a state of
	 almost total destruction, a few unlucky visitors knock your door. pirates are trying to open your hatch.
	 with a quick shot from your starboard cannon you blow up their petty excuse of a ship, leaving them stranded
	 and with no place to go.
	 this are your first crew memebers
	 }
	 
2.3 ------------ CHARACTER ----------
	the player represented as the AI is not important
2.5 ----------- LEVELS ------------
	{
	the spaceship will originally be wrecked and will have multiple levels, it will have to be restored
	by the player to it's original glory
	}

		3.1.2 ROOM AND ITEMS DESCRIPTION
		{
			1 bridge
				{
				 inside the bridge the shift's senior officers take stations in
				 their corresponding consoles, if the consoles are not manned all the 
				 rooms that depend on that department goes offline within a small amount of time
				}
			2 cargo hold
				{
				this is where stuff is stored
				}
			3 any room
				{
				no special room requirements 
				-could be a bathroom containing sonic shower for bathing or toilet, both need to be
				surrounded by walls. the shield generator must be adjacent to the ship's hull, the auxiliary
				
				-generator adds to the total power output or the connected power grid
				
				-the garbaje ejector eject's garbaje into outer space
 				 
				-the armour locker keeps combat armours and will be used on an alert
				 
				-the large TV displays display shows and idle crewmen may watching
				-large windows allow crewmen to look outside, fills recreation 
				-bookshelf fills recreation
				-protein resecuencer provides snacks when on duty
				-portrait no function
				-air pipes take oxigen to oxigen dispencers, those must be on every room
				whater pipes distribute water, needs to reach toilets, coffe machines, protein resecuencers, 
							the bar and the counter
				-electric cabling needs to be near every appliance, light and must touch important items
				-non-smoking sign prevents crewmen from smoking in a certain room
				-hammock (amaca paraguaya, para que los crewmen duerman tipo como en los barcos):
					allows crewmen to sleep when no quarters are aviable.
				}
				
			4 kitchen 
				{
				 this is where the cooks make the necesary meals, the number of meals is calculated
				 based on the ammount of people in the shift/s that will eat and the meal preparation 
				 starts a few hours before eating time
				}
			5 mess hall
				{
				 this is where crewmen eat their meals (cooks eat too after all the food is served)
				 crewmen prefer to eat with friends and will search the room for people who are their
				 friends before sitting in another table. some may want to eat near windows or stay reading
				 after they eat in a far appart place from the other crewmen.
				}
			6 sickbay
				{
				 this is where injured crewmen go to get healed and where the doctor and medics
				 spend their time working, random health checks may ocurr on off-duty crewmembers
				 just for the kicks. 
				 - very injured patients will get on the medical bay and get worked on by the doctor at
				 random intervals, health regeneration is very slow and the crewman may need to
				 stay in sickbay for a few days, there is a random chance of going into "near death"
				 state if health is beyond a certain threshhold
				 -lightly injured patients will stay in the medical bed for only a few seconds
				 while the doctor heals them
				 -near death patients will get a coundown and will need defibrilation with a 
				 crashcart and after will be treated as very injured patient
				 -after a predetermined random amount of defib's the patient dies
				 
				 paramedics bring patients to sickbay and place them in medical beds, if no medical beds
				 are aviable the patients will be placed on the floor, aviable crewmen will bring hammocks
				 and place them on sickbay to accomodate for extra patients, but they have x2 chance of 
				 "near death" on hammocks
				 
				 dead bodies are stored here too
				}
			7 staffroom
				{
				 in this room crewmen relax, read, talk to their families on the comm consoles
				 and buy soda can's and other luxuries, crewmen prefer to spend time with their friends 
				 here.
				}
			8 bar

				 crewmen who do not have duty between current time and sleep time may choose to stay 
				 at the bar, there they may dance, drink alcohol, talk with other crewmen or smoke
				 crewmen with high sex needs may rally here to look for a partner or to socialize in 
				 order to find another crewman with a high sex need.
				}
			9 hidrophonics bay
				{
				food may be grown here, hidrophonic shelfss have a growth cycle for food production
				}
			10 brigg
				{
				fighting or mutining crewmen may be thrown here as punishment, 
				after beeing in the brigg crewmen will cool down for a few days
				}
			11 reactor room
				{
				 this is where main propultion is, it has a main reactor and pipes that come
				 out of it and into a cooling tank and cooling vent's that are in the ships hull,
				 if the pipes are broken the reactor will shut down, the ship wount move and the power
				 generated by the reactor will be null
				}
			12 armoury
				{
				 this is where ammo, torpedos and extra weapons are stored and where weapons are mantained
				 weapons stored in lockers have a maintenence coeficient and need to be serviced after a certain
				 amount of time. used weapons in combat need to be reloaded at the armoury too.
				 
				 weapons in a crewmen inventory get it's maintenence coeficient drained faster
				 
				 people assigned at the armoury will search the ship looking for guns that need servicing, moving
				 torpedoes to torpedo launchers and keep a small amount of them stored there.
				}
			13 torpedo bay
				{
				 this is where torpedos are launched
				}
			
			14 chemistery lab
				{
				this is where ammo and torpedoes are built, whater and O2 may be sinthethized
				anything may be sinthethized here if there are "chemical components" aviable
				}
			15 crewmen quarters
				{
				the amount of beds indicates the amount of crewmen living together, if the number
				is smaller than 4 they may buy furniture to decorate the room acording to their perks
				object's will be placed adjacent to walls and not to doors
				}
			16 engeneering building bay
				{
				anything that you build in the space ship is first built here and then moved (entirely or in parts)
				to where you ordered the item, engeneers build what you order using raw materials, a certain
				ammount of them are stored in the room into shelfs, the rest is stored in the storage room.
				spare parts for damage repairs are also built here.

			20 services and life support
				{
				this is where life suppor equipment goes, whater tanks and oxygen tanks hold the needed substances 
				and if a pipe is punctured there will be loss of them until the pipe is cuted down or repaired.
				oxygen pipes ignite and will generate fires, water and oxygen recycling plants mantain the tank levels
				almost constant all the time, without them there will be a constant drain on the tanks.

		3.2.2-------crew members interaction
		{
		crew interaction is dominated by a number of variables
		
		1 the well-beeing coeficient: this number is calculated using the physiological needs, if it's not beyond
		a certain number, social interaction will not take place.
		
		2 friendlyness-coeficient: this is calculated using the safety needs, a crewman interactions will be
		affected by this number, below a certain number interactions can only be unfriendly, a high number will
		benefit friendliness, but it does not guarantee friendship.
		
		3 off duty talking-time: this number is the amount of time two crewmen talked outside of duty,
		the bigger this number, the friendship will get stronger
		
		4 on duty talking-time: counts toward friendship as 1/20th of the "off duty" talking time
		
		5 friendship-coeficient: calculated using the talked time that was above the friendliness coeficient and
		subtracting the talk time below the friendshipness coeficient. gets a determined amount subtracted 
		at certine long intervals to prevent everyone to become friends and make only close people friends.
		
		6 friendship-coeficient modifier: modifies the coeficient if the perks of the crewmen dictate so, may
		produce bad relationships.
		
		7 sex chance: a high enouth friendlyness coeficient and both crewmen sex need will generate a sex chance
		
		8 once sex takes place, those crewmen may became sex partners until one of them dies or their friendship
		stops.
		
		9 random fight: while talking, there is a small random chance of a disagreement that will randomly
		hurt the friendship
		
		10 crew member prefer to satisfy their needs with their friends unless a perk makes them prefer other
		people for that need
		
		11 crewmen will avoid other crewmen their perks tells them to avoid, if they get too close their friendship
		will go negative and they will be prone to fights.
}
		
		3.2.3-------need's satisfaction
			{
			MOST NEEDS INCREASE DIFFERENTLY FROM CREWMEN TO CREWMEN, some want to excersice or eat more than others
		
			this is how needs are satisfied:
			breathe: be in an O2=true room
			food: snack during work time, use mess hall at eating time or use protein secuencer during eat or free time
			sleep: sleep in a bed at sleep time or free time
			excrete: use bathroom at any time
			physical integrity: subtracted constantly when in combat or brawl or beeing injured, added very slowly when safe
			hygine: subtracted with time, added when shower
			send money to family: if family=true then there is a percentage of cash to be given to the family. the 
									need is fulfilled proportionally with the amount of cash sent.
			morale: if the general needs of the population are not met, the "morale" need will drop and general social
					unrest may be generated, fight chance increase.
			money to spare: have money, crewmen will spend money inside the ship and ashore to meet their needs, if
			                they get short of money before payday this need will increase.

			{
			when a crewman's friend dies, there is a high random chance that he may get a 
			psycological disorder and needs to see the psycologist for a few sessions before
			it goes away, he may pick up a perk (like conflictive or drinker) for the duration of
			the psycological disorder, there is a chance that the perk gained wount go away
			
			
			}

			-security crews:
								this crews will secure rooms and kill enemy boarding parties
			-HAZENV crews:
								hazardous environments crews will repair hull breaches, put
								out fires and repair turrets. they use special suits for this
			-paramedic crews:
								paramedics move injured crewmen to sickbay and defibrilate on-site if
								the room is safe
		squads are formed by player assigned crewmen and may get complemented by educated operations crewmen if
		there are not enougth people in the department to fill all squads.
		
		}
	3.6-------- COMBAT
			3.6.1 boarding combat
				all armed personell will shoot enemies on sight, unarmed personell will
				flee to where they came from if they see an enemy.
				
				security crews will be dispatched to enemy sightings automatically.
				small objects and walls work as cover. if a tile has visibility
				to the enemy and an adjacent tile does not, then that tile is considered as
				cover, the crewman will move to the visibility tile to shoot and go back to the

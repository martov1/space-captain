							3.2.2-------crew members interaction
		{
		crew interaction is dominated by a number of variables
		
		1 the well-beeing coeficient: this number is calculated using the physiological needs, if it's not beyond
		a certain number, social interaction will not take place.
		
		2 friendlyness-coeficient: this is calculated using the safety needs, a crewman interactions will be
		affected by this number, below a certain number interactions can only be unfriendly, a high number will
		benefit friendliness, but it does not guarantee friendship.
		
		3 off duty talking-time: this number is the amount of time two crewmen talked outside of duty,
		the bigger this number, the friendship will get stronger
		
		4 on duty talking-time: counts toward friendship as 1/20th of the "off duty" talking time
		
		5 friendship-coeficient: calculated using the talked time that was above the friendliness coeficient and
		subtracting the talk time below the friendshipness coeficient. gets a determined amount subtracted 
		at certine long intervals to prevent everyone to become friends and make only close people friends.
		
		6 friendship-coeficient modifier: modifies the coeficient if the perks of the crewmen dictate so, may
		produce bad relationships.
		
		7 sex chance: a friendship with a pre-determined sex along time generates a sex-chance
		
		8 once sex takes place, those crewmen will became sex partners until one of them dies or their friendship
		stops.
		
		9 random fight: while talking, there is a small random chance of a disagreement that will randomly
		hurt the friendship
		
		10 crew member prefer to satisfy their needs with their friends unless a perk makes them prefer other
		people for that need

		will go negative and they will be prone to fights.

									need is fulfilled proportionally with the amount of cash sent.
			morale: if the general needs of the population are not met, the "morale" need will drop and general social
					unrest may be generated, fight chance increase.
